# Response Parsed Body - Array Length (Paw Extension)

This Paw extension calculates the length of a response array. It only works for JSON responses at this time.

This might be useful alongside the [Chance Dynamic Value extension](https://github.com/tanshiqi/Paw-ChanceDynamicValue) if you want to pick a random element from a response array.
